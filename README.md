# Tiny-Iris

This is a very toy separation logic.
The only resources are heaps/points-tos, and a separation logic predicate is a predicate on heaps.
The logic is affine, i.e. one can discard points-tos.

We then build a weakest precondition in that logic and prove it adequate.

The dependencies are `coq=8.20.1,coq-iris=4.3.0`.

There are no examples (yet). There probably never will be.
